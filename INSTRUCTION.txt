- There are three levels of user in this app, they are student, staff, and admin.
- Each level of user have their own main privileges.

Admin : 
- Only administrator can register in this app and to prevent random people registering themselves as an admin i make an authentication hard-code inside the backend which 
  you can change as you want later.
- Default admin register code = MOKLETJAYA --> the code is case sensitive, so turn on your capslock before type this code.
- You can add both student and staff account from admin account. 
  -For student's account, the default username and password are their own NISN.
  -For staff's account, the default username and password are their own username. 
- You can generate every student's tuition fee payment report.
- Also, you can do CRUD for almost all data in this app, except student and staff account password.

Staff :
You can only do :
- Confirming and unconfirming student's tuition fee payment.
- Changing your personal information and account password.
 
Student :
You can only do :
- Submitting your tuition fee payment slip and waiting for verification from admin or staff.

If it necessary, I will update this app regularly to add more features and make this app better.

Please use this app wisely.
